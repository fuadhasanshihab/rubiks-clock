This is the javascript engine behind the great Instructable `Rubik's Clock` documented here: https://www.instructables.com/Rubiks-Clock/

The implementation is based on the javascript/HTML code of Cuber found at https://github.com/stewdio/Cuber-DEMO. Cuber is a Rubikâ€™s Cube simulator.  Rubik's Clock adds the concept of a photo cube to
Cuber.  The 6 PNG images are carefully crafted with a set of numbers on all sides.  It implements a solver that moves the pieces every minute so the numbers of the current hour and minute show on the front of the cube.


## Running Rubik's Clock

### From the desktop
There are two versions.  A 12-hour clock and a 24-hour clock.  The 12-hour clock rolls over at noon so the next hour is 1:00 (pm).  The 24-hour clock keeps counting up after noon so the next hour is 13:00.

From your Chrome browser (or Safari, or Edge, or a multitude of others) enter your choice:

- `index.html` for a 12-hour "am/pm" Rubick's clock (default)
- `index.html#clock12` for a 12-hour "am/pm" Rubick's clock

- `index.html#clock24` for a 24-hour "European" or "Military Time" clock

#### 12-hour
